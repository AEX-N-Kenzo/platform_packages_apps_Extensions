android_packages_apps_DUTweaks
==============================

All tabs are types of tweaks. All tabs have their own fragment in it's own class in it's own file. 

Attempting to join them will break the app, do not do this. 

The main reason for this is to break up the code to keep it clean and simple. Editing the Tweaks app before was horrible as you had every fragment in the same main java file. It was a PITA. 

Leave it like it is and only add tweaks. 

That is all.
