    <string name="dirtytweaks_main_message">Welcome to DU Tweaks.\n\nThis is the app that will allow you to change the look, feel, and capabilities of your device. If you do not understand a feature in DU Tweaks, please research it. If you are looking for something, please look in all settings before asking where it is at.\nIf something is not included, then we haven\'t added it! That doesn\'t mean it is missing and that doesn\'t mean you need to ask for it. Either we don\'t like the feature, we think it is pointless, or we are working on importing it and haven\'t finished it yet.\n\nPlease be patient and remember that this is a hobby for us, we don\'t get paid for it, and we provide it to you guys for FREE!!</string>
